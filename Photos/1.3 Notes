Notes on 1.3 (dealing with anti-forensics)

File signiture for a jpg file is FF D8, this is evident when looking at all the none corrupt files within the folder.

An appropriate tool to use to decrypt the files would be wxHexEditor, this allows us to edit the file signitures within the file and allows us to restore them.

Within a file located with the photoes was a files labled gpg password, this password didnt resemble anything todo with a passcode that would be used with gpg as that would useually be something rememberable so that you can unencrypt the file later. Using this string however i decided to try and decode it using a base 64 decoder. this then returned a value which was Pntr Jbeyq. Using this result however still didnt seem correct however it was very close to english at this point, so i then decided to employ a rot13 on the string as i believed this was encrypted. After decrypting the value i was given the value of Cage World which when run with the command gpg -d -o IMG_0099.jpg IMG_0099.jpg.gpg this then resulted in the file being decrypted and availible to use.
